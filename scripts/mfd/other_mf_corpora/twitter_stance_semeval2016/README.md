# Detecting Stance in Tweets

This dataset does not contain moral foundations. We use the "stance" label (for, against, neutral) to assess the relevance of moral foundations in each topic only.

The data can be downloaded [here](https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task6/).

We merge the training and test sets together.

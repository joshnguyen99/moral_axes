    Calibrate the test scores of a binary classifier using
    binary labels in the training set. The formula is
        p = p / (p + f_np * (1 - p))
    where p is the score of a test example and f_np is the 
    ratio between negative and positive examples in the training set.

    Calibrate the scores of a binary classifier using Platt scaling.

    where the parameters a and b are found by maximum likelihood.
    Platt scaling should be used for a held out dataset, as using it
